simple GNU Makefile collection to compile and upload C programs
to different AVR prototype boards

    1. create sub-directory containing sources (only one level!)
    2. create Makefile in sub-directory
    3. define TARGET:= and SOURCES:= at the top of your Makefile
    3. include appropriate Makefile in the parent-directory
    4. make clean; make && make upload


example Makefile::

    TARGET:=flashme
    SOURCES:=main.c utility.c
    include ../Makefile.uno
